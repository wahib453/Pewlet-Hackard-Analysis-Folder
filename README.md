## PURPOSE of ANALYSIS
> To determine the number of retiring employees based on title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## RESULTS
1. 
    
    There are quite a number of employees by title retiring. Referencing retiring_titles.csv table above, it reveals the top three titles including Senior Engineer, Senior Staff,   and Engineers have significant retirees than the bottom four titles. On the contrary, the number of employees eligible for mentorships are higher than those retiring. Looking at the mentorship_eligibility.csv file, a total of 499495 are eligible compare to a total of 90390 of those retiring. So a good number of employees are available to participate in the mentorship program. Moreover, the top three retiring titles should be the first priority the organization considers hiring. 

2. I don't think employees that are eligible for mentorships should be a problem. In this case, a query can be written to determine the number of retirees at the end of the current year and possible forcast the next year. Then eqaul number of mentors are raised and they trained the young employees. Moreover, they can have a mentorship title and can start mentoring as soon as they forseen short of employees.
